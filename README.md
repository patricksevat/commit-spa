## Requirements

- Use React or Angular ✅
- Css or SCSS/SASS ✅
- Commit overview
    - Fetch commits via Github API ✅
    - List view ✅
        - newest on top ✅
        - List item show first line of each commit + timestamp ✅
            - Use ellipsis ✅
        - Separate components for List + ListItem ✅
        - Date range ✅
- Commit detail page ✅
    - At least full commit message ✅
    - Others:
        - Timestamp ✅
        - Link to issues? Wont do ❌
        - Committer ✅
- Properly tested ⚠️
    - Add unit where needed ⚠️
    - TODO Add integration:
        - Navigation to detail page
            - Click external link
        - Check language switching
        - Check pagination
        - Check Date Picker

## Architecture

### Pages

- CommitOverviewPage
- CommitDetailPage

### Components

- CommitOverviewList
    - Loading spinner? Skeleton/shimmer component?
    - Lazy loading? Pagination?
- CommitOverviewListItem
- CommitOverviewDateRangePicker

### Services

- FetchCommitsService

### State management

- Redux? Context hook?
    - For this assignment Redux might be a bit overkill
    - TODO want to add Suspense?
    - TODO error handling? Perhaps Error Boundaries

### Testing

- Unit tests: use Enzyme for basic component tests, use Jest for service logic
- Integration tests: check if needed, could be that Enzyme is enough, otherwise Cypress. Will need to remove Puppeteer 
that came with template

### Focus points

- No focus on A11y, I've shown that in the previous demo
- No focus on theming, I've shown that in previous demo
- Focus on services
- Focus on testing

## Time log

### August 16th
- 10:45 - 11:20 create boilerplate / remove unused parts, start thinking about architecture, document in README.md
- 11:20 - 12:15 read up a bit on hooks, make a start on the CommitService
- 12:50 - 13:15 Implement StateContext and StateProvider
- 13:15 - 14:00 CommitService tests, 
- 14:00 - 15:00 start on OverviewPage
- 19:30 - 20:00 Show error when data fetching fails, add shimmer
- 20:00 - 20:45 Unit tests for CommitOverviewList (struggling with an Enzyme / useContext mocking issue)

### August 17th
- 08:30 - 08:40 refactor AppRouter.tsx
- 10:45 - 11:15 Make dates locale specific, connect StateContext and TranslationContext, update tests
- 11:45 - 11:40 fix CommitOverviewList.test.tsx
- Stopped tracking time from here as I felt I was going too slow and it was giving me pressure. 
So less detailed time tracking, more focus on quality
